# AWS Machine learning notes



**Lesson 2: Software Engg practice Pt1**

- Try **not** to reinvent the wheel, use existing code/reuse your code.

- Modular function

  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc.)
  - Functions should do one thing
  - Arbitrary variable names can be more effective in certain functions (eg: general functions)
  - fewer than three arguments per function

- Efficient code -> Execute faster, Reduce memory . Time - Space tradeoff

  1. Use vector operations rather than loops. *numpy and pandas*
  2. Know which data structures are faster
